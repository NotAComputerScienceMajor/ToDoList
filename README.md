# ToDoList
Just a todo list
This project aims to keep track of whatever is put in this todo list, in this case, it's homework
Challenges I have faced throughout this is probably finding the codes that are required for this to run smoothly
To use this code, simply just type the number of the function you want to do, the project should guide you on how to use it
